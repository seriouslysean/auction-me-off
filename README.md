# Auction Me Off

AuctionMeOff remembers the start price, buyout price and duration of any items you put up for auction across all characters. It also accounts for the number of items being auctioned so if you put more or less the start/buyout will be modified accordingly.

If you put up 5 pieces of Netherweave:

* **Start Price:** 5s
* **Buyout Price:** 25s
* **Duration:** 48 hours


If you later put up a full stack of 20 peices of Netherweave, the following would be placed in the auction for you:

* **Start Price:** 20s
* **Buyout Price:** 1g
* **Duration:** 48 hours

It saves time when putting up loads of auctions. I know this may be included with other addons but I wanted something that didn't have all the bells and whistles.
